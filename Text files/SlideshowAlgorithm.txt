Some thoughts about the slideshow algorigthm since it's going to be rather complicated.

I. Data fetching
a. Should I fetch thumbnails and full images differently?
b. How many thumnails should I fetch at one time?
c. Obviously, can't go fetch all thumnails first and then all larger images, since that would be gross. What logic should I use?
d. How does pre-caching work? 
e. How can I force expire the cache?
f. Have read only (compile time) settings that describe how big small/medium/original size images are. At runtime, query the browser's window size and then match against these stored values to figure out what size thumbnail to fetch for maximum efficiency.


II. Layout.
- Grid-like layout where images can occupy different amounts of area.
- The aspect ratio of images is not modified when displaying (*)
- The size of the image presented is dictated by 'Weight' property in database. ranges from 1 to x. 1 being heaviest.
- I'll partition the timeline into periods of 6 months. Within a 6 month period the images will be arranged by weight. The date will be date taken and not date uploaded.
- Most recent images will be on the left. So the scale extends to the right into the past. Will be great if this can be configurable.

III. Transitions and animations.
