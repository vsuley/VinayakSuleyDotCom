The Deployment saga

1. Figure out if the thing I'm trying to deploy is a website or a web app.
	- Look at visual studio project properties and see if you can figure something out.
		* Right clicking on project shows me an option to convert to web app. this is a sign that it's currently just a website.
	- I think I am building a website. I am going to move ahead with that assumption for now.
	
2. Change settings to be web site and see if it makes life any easier.
	- couldn't figure out what settings were 'web application' specific. didn't find anything.
	
3. Remove that stupid ASPNET database and the built-in authentication. It seems too heavyweight and might be adding an extra database.
	- I'll have ot implement my own logging solution. And for the time being, maybe I can prepopulate the database on my local machine before deploying
	- The consumer part of website seems to be working fine even with the aspnet tables gone. Will try manage next.
	- Strangely, the manage part seems to be working as well. Not sure how. Maybe [Authorize] is just returning true by default.
	
4. Now trying to deploy again, with a much more simplified database schema etc. First I tried deploying the release bits, but then realized that until I get the website working, would probably be a better idea to deploy debug.
	- Deploying debug bits to server by first deploying locally and then copying the bits over to the server using FTP.
	- Had to change folder structure to include a wwwroot folder under vinayaksuley.com on the server. wwwroot seems to be special since the server permissions that folder to be viewable from teh outside. Then things worked!

5. Need to figure out how to get better errors.
	- Made a transform addition to my custom build configuration to add customErrors mode="Off". copied new web.config over to server and started getting more detailed error.

6. Get the connection string to work.
	- Made some changes to connection string and now the connection string seems to work. But it can't find the tables I need.

7. Need to figure out how to migrate database to server.
	- 

8. Need to figure out how to copy images folder when creating a deployment package.
