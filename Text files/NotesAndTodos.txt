Todo - Current release
- Wire scroll wheel to photo panel sliding.
- If the slider is less than the width of the window then center it.
- Add the action of showing full image to browser history and ability to go back from it.

Todo - Next release
- Make allowances for shadows in layout algorightm (overflow=hidden messes with shadows)
- use overflow=hidden sparingly.
- Add cache-expiry headers
- Iterate over the content in text sections.
- find a way to not show that broken image icon while the image loads.
- Figure out how to throw some information onto a session cookie and how to throw other pieces of information onto a permanent cookie. Mostly for NSFW choices.
- Change backgrounds randomly and persist them for sessions.
- Look into error handling with ELMAH. Take a peek at NerdDinner for examples.
- Create a favicon.
- Get a security review from someone.
- Upload multiple photos at a time.
- quotes in filenames break the site!
- Create a settings page with admin access that will let you change the appsettings on the fly.
- Make all 500px tall containers more generic by assigning a class 'standardHeight' to them and have the height property of 500px defined in that class.

Done (second release)
- Resize math.
- Remove scrolling buttons and add on-mouse behavior. AWESOME! 
- Vertical positioning of text content should be smarter for various heights.
- Double check if recent photos is returning the right set.
- Order more recent first. Currently I think it's the other way round.
- Vertical positioning of the slider should be smarter for various heights.
- Download MS and Jquery scripts from websites from the web instead from your server.

Done (First release) March 18th 2011. Yay!!
- Replace table usage for non-tabular data by divs.
- Figure out how to use the settings file.
- Update page titles
- Add a background image.
- Start writing text blocks for sections.
- Mirror the scroll bars.
- Delete photo files on deletion of photo object.
- In cases when a tag is not found and you display the error message, see if you can include the tag in the error message to make the error less mysterious.
- Turn password protection back on for manage pages.
- Switch to using release versions of the microsoft ajax framework.
- Build a view for management.
- Wire up log-in functionality for manage view.
- Figure out how to use resource files for strings and text. Also figure out how to best maintain them.
- Figure out a layout for the manage screen.
- Start using a database instead of hardcoding construction.
- Figure out how to autogenerate a unique identifier.
- Read about the different HTTP methods and what they mean.
- Need to figure out a way to neatly pass in the tag to the portfolio page. Either have some sort of custom routing, or structure the controller class smartly. 
- Figure out how to upload a simple file.
- Figure out how to resize images on server.
- Right now there is a risk that if something fails between file upload and metadata writing, then there will be a dangling file with no DB entry. See if you can fix this.
- Make the manage-index page look halfway decent (no css magic, just basic layout)
- Make the edit photo data page look halfway decent.  (no css magic, just basic layout)
- Make the delete page look halfway decent. (no css magic, just basic layout)
- Start reading up on animation using javascript.
- Wire left and right arrow keys to photo panel sliding.

Shelved:
- Add a vinayaksuley.com text somewhere.
- Look up some articles online that describe how to optimize a database for tagbased lookup.
	Reason: I will rely on searching through tags in the DB. Will revisit if time-permits or perf is unacceptable.
- Read up some basics on SQL queries. (try searching for SQL cheat sheet or something)
	Reason: Getting by for now. Will revist as needed.

Too Vague:
- Update all paths to be relative. Look out for image paths in DB and Database path in connection string.

Deployment troubleshooting:
- Had to install asp.net, didn't come when I installed IIS.
- Had to then install asp.net 4.0 from command line using: c:\windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\aspnet_regiis.exe -ir
- Need to change deployment configuration to copy over Images directory as well??
- Need to figure out how to configure the SQL server database upon publishing.
- App pool identity needs access to SQL server
- Update the connection string to: (removed the explicit location to mdf)
	- <add name="SqlServices"              connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=VSDotCom;                 Integrated Security=True;User Instance=True" />
    - <add name="VSDotComEntities" connectionString="metadata=res://*/Models.VSDotCom.csdl|res://*/Models.VSDotCom.ssdl|res://*/Models.VSDotCom.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;         Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=VSDotCom;           Integrated Security=True;User Instance=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True&quot;" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
- Somehow make sure your tables exist and are up to date


Feedback:
- Ashima
	* Commas look like a bad idea.
	* READY FOR PRIME TIME? 

- Rohan
	* Like cell bgs and photo concept.
	* randomization is good.
	* horizontal slider is good.
	* Thinks the siteBG is too dull, color is boring. Too little contrast in energy.
	! * Main menu, commas are extra. Again, low contrast.
	! * no mouse in Full mode is a handicap.
	! * Scroll wheel?
	! * Agress that slider should run through the screen.
	* READY FOR PRIME TIME? Probably not. Needs more justification...how is it different from Facebook?
